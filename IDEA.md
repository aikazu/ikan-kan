# Ikan Kan: Mancing Mania

## Core Concept
Ikan Kan: Mancing Mania is an incremental idle game where players start with a single fish in a small pond and build up to a vast oceanic empire. Players click to catch fish, which serve as the primary currency, then invest in upgrades to automate and expand their fishing operations from a backyard pond to the depths of the ocean.
