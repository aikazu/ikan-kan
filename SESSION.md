# Ikan Kan: Mancing Mania - Session Log

## Session 1: Project Setup and Core Implementation

**Session Identifier**: S001  
**Focus**: Foundation phase - Setting up the core game mechanics and UI

### Goals Achieved in S001

- Set up project structure with Create React App
- Installed key dependencies (Redux, Material-UI, Framer Motion)
- Implemented core game state with Redux Toolkit
- Created the game loop with tick handling and auto-save
- Built the basic UI components for the game interface
- Implemented the save/load system using localStorage
- Added offline progress calculation
- Created data structures for fish and upgrades
- Implemented the upgrade purchase system

### Modified Files in S001

- `/PLANNING.md` - Defined project vision and milestones
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Documented system architecture and patterns
- `/TECH-STACK.md` - Detailed technology choices
- `/TASK.md` - Set up task tracking and progress monitoring
- `/ikan-kan/src/store/index.js` - Set up Redux store
- `/ikan-kan/src/store/gameSlice.js` - Implemented game state slice
- `/ikan-kan/src/utils/storage.js` - Created storage utilities
- `/ikan-kan/src/game/core.js` - Implemented game loop
- `/ikan-kan/src/data/upgrades.js` - Created upgrade data
- `/ikan-kan/src/data/fish.js` - Created fish collection data
- `/ikan-kan/src/components/GameScreen.js` - Main game screen layout
- `/ikan-kan/src/components/FishingArea.js` - Clickable fishing area

- `/ikan-kan/src/components/UpgradePanel.js` - Upgrade purchasing UI
- `/ikan-kan/src/App.js` - Updated to use our components

### Next Steps After S001

1. **Core Gameplay Polish**
   - Test the core click mechanics and upgrade system
   - Adjust game balance for starting progression

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Implement achievements system (T008)
   - Add more visual feedback for fishing action
   - Implement fish discovery notifications

3. **Phase Progression**
   - Begin implementing phase transition from Pond to Lake (T011)
   - Create unlock conditions for environment advancement

### Notes and Challenges in S001

- The game follows an incremental design pattern with idle mechanics
- Current balance focuses on the early pond phase
- Future enhancements will focus on deeper progression systems
- Need to maintain a balance between active clicking and idle progression

### Questions for After Session 1

- How should we structure the achievement system?
- What should be the unlock criteria for advancing to the Lake phase?
- How can we make the fish catching visual more engaging?

## Session 2: UI Enhancement

**Session Identifier**: S002  
**Focus**: UI improvements and refinements

### Session Goals for S002

- Improve the UI layout for better usability
- Make the resource display background transparent
- Reposition the Info button for better consistency

### Completed Changes in S002

- Removed Info button from title bar and relocated it to the bottom right corner of the game area
- Enhanced ResourceDisplay component to accept custom styling through sx prop
- Added a semi-transparent Paper wrapper around ResourceDisplay for better visibility
- Maintained visual consistency between Upgrade and Info buttons with matched styling
- Updated ESLint warnings by removing unused imports

### Active Files in S002

- `ikan-kan/src/components/GameScreen.js` - Main game UI container
- `ikan-kan/src/components/ResourceDisplay.js` - Resource counter display

### Decisions Made in S002

- Info button should be inside the game area with the Upgrade button for better UI consistency
- ResourceDisplay should have a transparent background but with a semi-transparent wrapper for text visibility
- Title bar should be simplified with just the game title and reset button

### Upcoming Tasks After S002

- Continue UI refinements for better user experience
- Implement achievement system (Task T008)
- Add more visual feedback for fish catching (Task T019)
- Consider implementing a tutorial system (Task T022)

### Issues and Concerns for S002

- Need to test UI on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness
- May need to adjust spacing between resource counters on smaller screens
- Should consider adding visual feedback for button interactions

## Session 3: Repository Configuration

**Session Identifier**: S003  
**Focus**: Version control setup and repository organization

### Session Goals for S003

- Configure proper Git repository structure
- Set up GitHub remote repository
- Ensure all project files are properly tracked
- Organize file structure for better maintainability

### Completed Changes in S003

- Initialized Git repository in the project workspace
- Created appropriate .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and build files
- Configured remote GitHub repository at [https://github.com/aikazu/ikan-kan.git](https://github.com/aikazu/ikan-kan.git)
- Fixed issue with nested .git directory in ikan-kan subdirectory
- Organized project files to ensure proper tracking of both documentation and source code
- Ensured all workspace files (not just ikan-kan directory) are properly included

### Active Files in S003

- `.gitignore` - Git exclusion patterns
- Documentation files in the root directory
- Source code in the ikan-kan directory

### Decisions Made in S003

- All documentation should reside in the root workspace directory
- Source code should remain in the ikan-kan subdirectory
- node_modules should be excluded from version control
- All markdown documentation files should be tracked by git

### Upcoming Tasks After S003

- Implement achievement system (Task T008)
- Consider adding a contribution guide for potential contributors
- Review and update documentation to ensure it reflects current project state

### Issues and Concerns for S003

- Need to determine a branching strategy for future development
- Consider whether to implement automated testing for future pull requests
- May need to add GitHub Actions for CI/CD in the future
