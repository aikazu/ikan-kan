## Checkpoint CP006
**Timestamp**: Progress on Rare Lake Fish Implementation (T008)
**Status**: Lake fish species defined, unlock mechanisms via phase change and new research items established.
**Implementation Status Summary**: 
- `components/UpgradePanel.js`: Added "Vessels" category to tabs and related logic.
- `data/fishSpecies.js`: Defined `default_lake_fish`, `lake_trout`, and `golden_perch`.
- `store/index.js` (`gameLogicMiddleware`):
    - Auto-discovers `default_lake_fish` upon transitioning to 'lake' phase.
    - Existing logic handles `unlockFish` effects from research items.
- `data/research.js`: Added `lake_ecology_study` (unlocks `lake_trout`) and `advanced_sonar_techniques` (unlocks `golden_perch`) research items with appropriate unlock conditions (game phase, prerequisite research).

**Active Branches and Component Status**:
  - `main` (or `master`) branch contains these updates.
  - Key files involved: `data/fishSpecies.js`, `data/research.js`, `store/index.js`.

**Environment Configuration**:
- (As per CP001, assuming no changes)

**Next Steps Upon Resuming (for T008)**:
1.  Update game logic (`gameSlice.js` -> `catchFish` reducer) to handle special bonuses from new Lake fish (e.g., `knowledgeChance` for `golden_perch`).
2.  Update UI if necessary to reflect new fish or their bonuses (e.g., `FishingArea.js` if visual diversity increases, or notifications for special drops).
3.  Test the discovery and effects of new Lake fish.

2.  Begin planning for Phase 3: Coastal Waters, defining new tasks (T010 onwards).
    - Establish coastal fishing operations.
    - Build your first commercial fishing fleet.
    - Research marine biology for fish breeding.
    - Implement sustainable fishing practices.
    - Develop fish processing facilities.
3.  Consider UI/UX refinements, notification systems, and visual diversity enhancements for existing phases if time permits or as separate improvement tasks.
